We will create a Python project with pytest and dataclasses.

Here is the code to do that:\n\n\n```python\n\nmkdir myproject\ncd myproject\necho \""pytest==7.1.2\"" >> requirements.txt\necho \""dataclasses==0.8\"" >> requirements.txt\n\n```\n```python\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo output available on console.\n```\n**Recap of the plan:** We are creating a Python project with pytest and dataclasses.
