================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll assume you want me to create a Python project. Since you didn't specify a particular task or problem to solve, I'll create a simple project that demonstrates a basic architecture.

Let's create a project that simulates a simple banking system. We'll have classes for `Account`, `Customer`, and `Bank`. The `Bank` class will manage a list of customers, and each customer will have one or more accounts.

Here's the project structure:

```
banking_system
requirements.txt
src
__init__.py
account.py
bank.py
customer.py
main.py
tests
__init__.py
test_account.py
test_bank.py
test_customer.py
```

Here's the code for each file:

**requirements.txt**
```
pytest
dataclasses
```

**src/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**src/account.py**
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Account:
    """Represents a bank account."""
    account_number: int
    balance: float = 0.0

    def deposit(self, amount: float) -> None:
        """Deposit money into the account."""
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount: float) -> None:
        """Withdraw money from the account."""
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient balance")
        self.balance -= amount
```

**src/bank.py**
```
from typing import List
from .account import Account
from .customer import Customer

class Bank:
    """Represents a bank."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.customers: List[Customer] = []

    def add_customer(self, customer: Customer) -> None:
        """Add a customer to the bank."""
        self.customers.append(customer)

    def get_customer(self, customer_id: int) -> Customer:
        """Get a customer by ID."""
        for customer in self.customers:
            if customer.customer_id == customer_id:
                return customer
        return None
```

**src/customer.py**
```
from dataclasses import dataclass
from .account import Account

@dataclass
class Customer:
    """Represents a bank customer."""
    customer_id: int
    name: str
    accounts: List[Account] = None

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.accounts = []

    def add_account(self, account: Account) -> None:
        """Add an account to the customer."""
        self.accounts.append(account)
```

**src/main.py**
```
from .bank import Bank
from .customer import Customer
from .account import Account

def main():
    bank = Bank()

    customer1 = Customer(customer_id=1, name="John Doe")
    customer1.add_account(Account(account_number=1234))
    customer1.add_account(Account(account_number=5678))

    bank.add_customer(customer1)

    print(bank.get_customer(1).accounts)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**tests/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**tests/test_account.py**
```
from unittest import TestCase
from src.account import Account

class TestAccount(TestCase):
    def test_deposit(self):
        account = Account(account_number=1234)
        account.deposit(100.0)
        self.assertEqual(account.balance, 100.0)

    def test_withdraw(self):
        account = Account(account_number=1234)
        account.deposit(100.0)
        account.withdraw(50.0)
        self.assertEqual(account.balance, 50.0)
```

**tests/test_bank.py**
```
from unittest import TestCase
from src.bank import Bank
from src.customer import Customer

class TestBank(TestCase):
    def test_add_customer(self):
        bank = Bank()
        customer = Customer(customer_id=1, name="John Doe")
        bank.add_customer(customer)
        self.assertIn(customer, bank.customers)
```

**tests/test_customer.py**
```
from unittest import TestCase
from src.customer import Customer
from src.account import Account

class TestCustomer(TestCase):
    def test_add_account(self):
        customer = Customer(customer_id=1, name="John Doe")
        account = Account(account_number=1234)
        customer.add_account(account)
        self.assertIn(account, customer.accounts)
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
