================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Request: gradioでplantumlの表示

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Here is a fully functional implementation of a Gradio app that displays PlantUML diagrams.

**requirements.txt**
```
gradio
plantuml
```

**app.py**
```
import gradio as gr
from plantuml import PlantUML

puml = PlantUML()

def generate_diagram(code):
    puml.processes_file("diagram.puml", code)
    with open("diagram.png", "rb") as f:
        img = f.read()
    return img

iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=generate_diagram, 
    inputs="text", 
    outputs="image", 
    title="PlantUML Diagram Generator"
)

iface.launch()
```

**plantuml.py**
```
import subprocess

class PlantUML:
    def processes_file(self, filename, code):
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            f.write("@startuml\n")
            f.write(code)
            f.write("@enduml\n")
        subprocess.run(["plantuml", "-tpng", filename])
```

This implementation consists of two files: `app.py` and `plantuml.py`. 

`app.py` is the entry point of the Gradio app, which takes in a PlantUML code as input, generates a diagram using the `PlantUML` class, and displays the resulting image.

`plantuml.py` contains the `PlantUML` class, which is responsible for generating the diagram from the input code using the PlantUML command-line tool.

To run the app, simply execute `python app.py` in the terminal, and open the app in a web browser.

This concludes a fully working implementation.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Here is the implementation of a Gradio interface that displays a PlantUML diagram.

**requirements.txt**
```
gradio
plantuml
```

**gradio_plantuml_interface.py**
```
import gradio as gr
from plantuml import PlantUML

class GradioPlantUMLInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plantuml = PlantUML()

    def generate_diagram(self, uml_code):
        """
        Generate a PlantUML diagram from the given UML code
        """
        diagram = self.plantuml.get_svg_string(uml_code)
        return diagram

    def create_interface(self):
        """
        Create a Gradio interface to input UML code and display the generated diagram
        """
        with gr.Blocks() as demo:
            with gr.Row():
                uml_code = gr.Textbox(label="UML Code")
                generate_button = gr.Button("Generate Diagram")
            diagram = gr.Image(label="Diagram")

            def generate_diagram(uml_code):
                return self.generate_diagram(uml_code)

            generate_button.click(fn=generate_diagram, inputs=uml_code, outputs=diagram)

        return demo

if __name__ == "__main__":
    interface = GradioPlantUMLInterface()
    demo = interface.create_interface()
    demo.launch()
```

This implementation defines a `GradioPlantUMLInterface` class that has a `generate_diagram` method to generate a PlantUML diagram from UML code, and a `create_interface` method to create a Gradio interface to input UML code and display the generated diagram.

The `generate_diagram` method uses the `plantuml` library to generate an SVG string from the input UML code.

The `create_interface` method creates a Gradio interface with a text box to input UML code, a button to generate the diagram, and an image component to display the generated diagram. When the button is clicked, the `generate_diagram` method is called with the input UML code, and the resulting diagram is displayed in the image component.

To run the interface, simply execute the `gradio_plantuml_interface.py` file.

This concludes a fully working implementation.
