5. Replace `YOUR_PLANTUML_API_KEY` and `YOUR_PLANTUML_API_SECRET` with your PlantUML API key and secret.

## Usage

1. Run the `getLineImageData` function to retrieve the image data from LINE.
2. Run the `saveImageToDrive` function to save the image data to Google Drive.
3. Run the `generateSequenceDiagram` function to generate a sequence diagram using PlantUML.
