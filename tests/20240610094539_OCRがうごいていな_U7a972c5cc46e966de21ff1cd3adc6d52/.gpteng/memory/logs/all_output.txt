================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Request: OCRがうごいていないなOCRがうごいていないな

It seems like you want me to implement an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Python. Here's a fully functional implementation:

**Project Structure:**
```

ocr_model.py

**requirements.txt:**

**src/__init__.py:**

# empty file
```

**src/main.py:**
```
from models.ocr_model import OCRModel
from utils.image_processing import preprocess_image

def main():
    # Load the OCR model
    ocr_model = OCRModel()

    # Load the image
    image_path = 'path/to/image.jpg'
    image = preprocess_image(image_path)

    # Perform OCR
    text = ocr_model.recognize_text(image)

    print("Recognized text:", text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**src/models/__init__.py:**
```
# empty file

**src/models/ocr_model.py:**
```
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

class OCRModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tesseract_config = '-c tessedit_char_whitelist=0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz --psm 11'

    def recognize_text(self, image):
        # Perform OCR using Tesseract
        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, config=self.tesseract_config)
        return text
```

**src/utils/__init__.py:**
```
# empty file
```

**src/utils/image_processing.py:**
```
from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Open the image
    image = Image.open(image_path)

    # Convert to grayscale
    image = image.convert('L')

    # Apply thresholding
    image = image.point(lambda x: 0 if x < 140 else 255)

    # Apply binary inversion
    image = image.point(lambda x: 255 - x)

    # Apply median filter
    image = image.filter(ImageFilter.MedianFilter(size=3))

    return image
```

**tests/test_ocr_model.py:**
```
import unittest
from models.ocr_model import OCRModel

class TestOCRModel(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_recognize_text(self):
        ocr_model = OCRModel()
        image = Image.new('L', (100, 100))
        text = ocr_model.recognize_text(image)
        self.assertIsInstance(text, str)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

**tests/test_image_processing.py:**
```
import unittest
from utils.image_processing import preprocess_image

class TestImageProcessing(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_preprocess_image(self):
        image_path = 'path/to/image.jpg'
        image = preprocess_image(image_path)
        self.assertIsInstance(image, Image.Image)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

This concludes a fully working implementation of an OCR system using Python.
